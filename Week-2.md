# Coding 2 : Advanced Frameworks

## 2019-2020

Professor Mick Grierson

## Week 2 - C++ and openFrameworks

This week we will be looking at openFrameworks, making sure we understand how to set it up, and exploring basic examples and concepts. We'll also be looking at some more complex examples, such as the Maximilian C++ library for audio, and in particular thinking about what pointers are and when we might consider using them.

openFrameworks has been around for a long time, and is a great way of creating C++ projects for media and computational arts. As a result, it's a standard Framework in industry for developing media work. It has a large community, some of whom are very active at CCI. There are comprehensive tutorials online, and a massive library of addons (some of which might not work, so be warned). But in general, if you are trying to do something in C++ and you don't want to deal with the hassle of setting up your own graphics, sound and interaction environment for prototyping, it's a great way to get started.

## What we will cover this session

### Getting started
- Getting openFrameworks
- OF folder structure. Where is everything and why?
- build settings for your platform (SDKs, paths)
- openFrameworks project structure (main, ofApp)
- Creating and using an empty project
- Documentation and examples
- Exercise : Your first OF project
- Addons and how to use them
- ofxMaxim example
- Pointers and Arrays, the Stack and the Heap
- address-of operators and dereference operators
- New and Delete, Malloc and Free, Reference Counting == no.
- How and why ofxMaxim uses pointers
- Image Processing, Fractals and 3D in OF

- Exercise : Porting a simple project from JavaScript to OF
