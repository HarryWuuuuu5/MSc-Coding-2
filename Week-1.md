# Coding 2 : Advanced Frameworks

# Week 1 - Introduction to C++

This week we will be learning some fundamentals of C++. We won't be trying to become the world's greatest C++ programmers in one day. Instead, we'll be learning the simplest possible subset of C++ approaches that we will need in order to get things done.

C++ is about the most complex language there is. It's also probably the best language you can master in terms of speed, power and flexibility. However, you can do almost everything you need to do in C++ by following a basic C-style coding approach that is common in lots of languages including JavaScript, which you will know reasonably well by now. If you take this approach, then it's simply a matter of learning a couple of fundamentals, and then slowly developing your vocabulary over time.

Fundamentally, the rule of thumb here is don't try to understand everything all at once - just focus on the essentials, and worry about the complexities once you feel confident with the basics.

## What we will cover this session

- Getting up and running with an Integrated Development Environment
- Understanding the basics of working with C++ as a language

This is a **CRASH COURSE** but should not be too hard given how much time we have spent learning JavaScript using C++ constructs. 

The things I'll be introducting you today are as follows:

- main.cpp
- #include
- printing to the console
- data types
- conditionals
- loops
- functions
- preprocessing and compilation
- C++ objects / classes
- .h (hpp) .cpp pairs
- basic macros
- declaring and defining a class
- including and using classes in a project


# BUT FIRST

## You need to get set up with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

There are a couple of options.

- Xcode (Download from the macOS App store)

The current version of Xcode will require you to use the most recent macOS operating system. If you really don't want to update your computer, you can sign up for a free apple developer account and download a version that works on your operating system by exploring the available links here: 

https://developer.apple.com/download/more/

- MS Visual Studio (Download from the visual studio website here

- https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/

This is what you should use if you're on windows.

The current version of Visual Studio claims to allow you to compile C++ code on macOS, which is technically true, but it's not as easy to do this as you might think.

## Linux

You can do everything you need to on the command line using GCC, G++ and MAKE. We will be exploring this later in the course but just make sure your linux distribution has the latest GCC and everything will be fine. 

# OpenFrameworks

Following this introduction, we're going to take a look at openFrameworks, which provides lots of functionality for you to explore whilst you settle in to your new C++ chops.
